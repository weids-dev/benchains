**"A Gaming Platform for Benchmarking Layer 2 Scalability on Hyperledger Fabric"**


The aim is to create a versatile and scalable multiplayer gaming application named "Wrappers", built on Hyperledger Fabric.
This platform will serve as a foundation to evaluate and compare the performance and scalability benefits of various Layer 2 scaling solutions, including state channels, plasma, sidechains, and rollups. By leveraging the controllability of Hyperledger Fabric, "Wrapper" will offer insights into the best-suited scaling solutions for different use cases, focusing on scalability and efficiency in a controlled environment.
